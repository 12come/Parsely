He was simply exploring the city every day when he stumbled upon a "balloon" seller. He chuckled and thought to himself, "Why not give it a try?" He purchased one and took it home. 

He blew it up and released it into the air. He watched the "balloon" soar higher and higher until it was lost in the sky. He felt a sense of joy and amazement, feeling as though he had accomplished something grand. 

He was inspired to do this every day and soon enough he had a large collection of "balloons". He would take them out at night and watch them shine in the moonlight. He created a joke to himself: "I'm not an astronaut, I'm just a "balloon" explorer". 

He continued to explore the world with his "balloons", feeling small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. He found peace in this, and was content with simply observing the world from a distance.
